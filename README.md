## About
This is binary calculator, which takes two binary numbers as input and displays the output in binary form.
<br>
##### Note:
It is quite robust as it can detect invalid expressions like "1--1"<br> or invalid mathematical expressions like "1/0".
<br>
If you still find some functionality that is not working then create a pull request.
Division is integer division. All numbers are positive.
